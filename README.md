# HostelLife

Client - frontend
Server - backend

# Branches

Please create your own branches before commit.

# Build Basic Structure

1.  Frontend
    - Create a react app inside the repository HostelLife and inside the client file.
    - Make sure it should display something (for e.g. “Hello world”).
2.  Backend
    - Create a simple API (using Node.js inside server file)
    - Make sure it should display something (for e.g. “Hello world”).


(For the Second and Third part guys can work together)

# POST/event (Backend)

- This endpoint will be used to create new events.
- It should receive all data related to the event (title, description, and startTime).
- It should store the new event in the data.


# Basic page layout (Frontend)

- See the Specific activity page from the presentation.
- Create all the activities buttons.
- Use CSS to make it look good.
- No need to create the rest of the part for now (like nav-bar, search-bar, or upload picture).


# Get/event (Backend)

- This endpoint will be used to retrieve all the events that are stored in the database.


# Connect Frontend and Backend

- Connect all the frontend and backend activities.
